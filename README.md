# Music-Platform:
 - A program that allows users to search for song recommendation by country, genre, and music type.
 - The program uses html, css, and javascript
 - YouTube Data API and Youtube Player API were used for the program
 - Data API searches for the songs
 - Player API creates an iframe and displays the video on the page


# Purpose:
 - To help people discover new music from diffrent regions of the world
 - Learned more on how API works
 - Project to showcase 

# Current Issues:
 - Iframe player does not display the video on the page, but allows you to view the video on Youtube
 - If clicking in the highlighed word
 - Solution: Possibly need to incude node express in my project, to help with HTTP utility, will need to learn

# Future Plans:
 - Fix current issues
 - Add a feature that allows you to switch to another video of the same category
 - Possibly a clickable arrow 
 - Maybe include React into the project
